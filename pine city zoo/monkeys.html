                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p> Monkeys are a group of primates that are characterized by their long tails, agile bodies, and social behavior. They are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountains. Monkeys are known for their intelligence and complex social structures, often living in large groups called troops.</p>
                    <p>There are two main types of monkeys: New World monkeys, which are found in Central and South America, and Old World monkeys, which are found in Africa and Asia. New World monkeys have prehensile tails that they use to grasp branches, while Old World monkeys do not. Monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals.</p>

                        <p> You will find the monkey cage at GO13.</p>
