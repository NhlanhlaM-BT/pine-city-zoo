                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p> The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae, which is part of the infraclass Metatheria, a group that includes all marsupials. The koala is found in coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia, inhabiting eucalypt forests and woodlands. It is a nocturnal animal, spending most of its life sleeping in trees and feeding on eucalyptus leaves.</p>
                    <p>The koala's diet consists almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals in the leaves. Koalas are known for their distinctive appearance, with large round ears, a flat nose, and a stout body covered in thick fur. They are also known for their unique vocalizations, which include grunts, snores, and bellows.</p>
                     <p><strong> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                        <p> You will find the koala cage at GO10.</p>
